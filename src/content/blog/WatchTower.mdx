### Chapter 1: The Tower of the Flock
#### The Sorrow and the Right Hand

> *And Jacob set up a memorial stone over her grave; that is the memorial stone of Rachel’s grave to this day. Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder."* (**Genesis 35:21**)

Long ago, in the rolling hills of Canaan, there stood a special tower called *Migdal Eder*, which means “Tower of the Flock.” It was made of strong, rugged stones that had stood the test of time, reaching high above the green fields. The shepherds loved this tower because it was their shelter—a place where they could watch over their sheep and keep them safe. At the base of the tower, the sheep rested peacefully in pens, while inside, shepherds cared for newborn lambs, gently wrapping them in soft cloths to protect them during the cool nights.

For generations, the tower stood like a silent guardian, watching over the shepherds and their flocks. Its steady presence kept them safe from prowling wild animals and storms. But *Migdal Eder* didn’t just see the joyful moments of grazing sheep and playful lambs—it also witnessed the deep sorrow of a man named Jacob, who passed by carrying a heavy heart after losing someone he dearly loved.

Jacob’s heart was heavy as he placed a stone near the tower. His beloved wife, Rachel, had just passed away after giving birth to their son. With her last breath, she had named him Ben-Oni, which means "son of my sorrow." But Jacob, through his tears, gave him a new name: Benjamin, "son of my right hand."

> *The Lord is my shepherd,
I will not be in need.
He lets me lie down in green pastures;
He leads me beside quiet waters.* (**Psalms 23:1-2**)

The tower stood still, its shadow stretching over Jacob as he mourned. It had seen his loss, but it also saw the love Jacob had for his family. The tower, like God the Father, watched over Jacob and Benjamin, silently reminding them that sorrow could be turned into hope. As Jacob began to leave, the shepherds returned to their work under the watchful eye of the tower, keeping them safe.

### Chapter 2: The Kinsman Redeemer

> *"May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."* (**Ruth 2:12**)

Years passed, and the tower continued to watch over the fields. One day, it noticed a woman named Ruth working hard to gather grain. Ruth was not from Bethlehem; she was from Moab. But she had chosen to stay with her mother-in-law, Naomi, after losing her husband. Ruth’s kindness and loyalty shone brightly, even in her sadness.

As Ruth worked, the tower saw a man named Boaz, the owner of the fields, take notice of her. Boaz was kind and generous, making sure Ruth had enough grain to take home. The tower watched as their friendship grew, and eventually, Boaz became Ruth’s kinsman redeemer. He married her and gave her a new beginning.

Ruth and Boaz’s grandson, Jesse, would become the father of David, the shepherd who would one day become a king. Ruth’s story of loss and love reminded the tower of God’s promises to comfort and be close to His people, no matter where they are from.

### Chapter 3: The Anointed and Awaited King

> *"Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David."* (**1 Samuel 16:13**)

The fields near the Migdal Eder were peaceful as a young shepherd named David tended his father’s sheep. The tower had seen David many times, singing songs to God as he cared for the flock. But one day, something very special happened.

The prophet Samuel came to visit David’s family. God had sent Samuel to anoint the next king of Israel, and to everyone’s surprise, God chose David, the youngest brother. The tower watched as Samuel poured oil over David’s head, marking him as the future king. The Spirit of the Lord filled David, and the tower could almost feel the excitement of what was to come.

David would grow up to be a great king, but he never forgot the fields where he had cared for his sheep. The tower stood tall, always vigilant, having witnessed the beginning of David’s incredible journey as the man after God's own heart.

### Chapter 4: The Shepherd Priests and the Newborn Lamb

> *As for you, tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you it will come—yes, the former dominion will come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem."* (**Micah 4:8**)

Many years later, the fields of Bethlehem Ephrathah were no longer ordinary fields. They became a special place where lambs were raised for sacrifices at the Temple of God in Jerusalem. The shepherds who cared for these flocks were not just regular shepherds—they were priests, trusted with a very important job.

The Migdal Eder, the Tower of the Flock, stood tall over these fields, watching as the shepherd priests did their work. When a ewe was about to have a baby lamb, the shepherds would gently guide her into a clean room at the base of the tower. This room was kept spotless because the lambs born there had to be perfect—without any spots, blemishes, or injuries. These lambs would one day be used for sacrifices to bring the people closer to God.

As the lambs were born, the shepherd priests carefully checked them. If a lamb was perfect, they wrapped it in soft cloths to keep it safe and clean. Then they laid the lamb in a stone manger, where it could rest quietly. These perfect lambs were very special. When they were old enough, the priests would carry them to Jerusalem, through the Lamb’s Gate, to be offered as sacrifices during Passover.

The tower watched all of this with quiet wonder. Every perfect lamb reminded the tower of something greater that was coming—a perfect Lamb who would one day save the whole world. The Migdal Eder knew its purpose was part of a bigger plan, and it waited for the day when the ultimate Lamb of God would be born under its watchful eye.

### Chapter 5: The Journey to Bethlehem

> *Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth. This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all the people were on their way to register for the census, each to his own city. Now Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David."* (**Luke 2:1–4**)

The roads leading to Bethlehem were busy with travelers. The Roman Emperor had ordered a census, and families from far and wide returned to their ancestral towns to be registered. Among these travelers was a young couple from Nazareth. The man, Joseph, led the way, guiding their donkey over the dusty paths. His wife, Mary, sat quietly on the animal’s back, her face glowing with the gentle anticipation of motherhood. She was carrying a child—a child whose arrival had been foretold by an angel.

> *Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary. And coming in, he said to her, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was very perplexed at this statement, and was pondering what kind of greeting this was. And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you shall name Him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end."* (**Luke 1:26-33**)

As the couple entered Bethlehem, they were met with the bustling noise of the crowded town. Travelers filled every available space in the inns, leaving no room for latecomers like Joseph and Mary. Rejected by the innkeeper and with no other options in the busy city, Joseph led Mary back outside the town, searching for a place where she could give birth safely and with some measure of warmth.

Just beyond the city, the Tower of the Flock rose against the horizon. Its silhouette stood out in the fading light, and it seemed to shine as though illuminated by a divine beacon. Drawn to the tower, the couple made their way toward it, feeling as though God Himself was guiding their steps. Mary’s time was near, and they needed shelter. The tower, where shepherds once swaddled newborn lambs, would soon serve a greater purpose than anyone could have imagined.

### Chapter 6: The Angels and the Sign of the Manger (*Luke 2:8–12*)

![The Shepherds and Angels](/images/ShepherdsAngels.jpg)

> *In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock at night. And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood near them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. And so the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people; for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.'"* (**Luke 2:8–12**)

As Mary gave birth to her son in the quiet shelter of the Tower of the Flock, the fields outside Bethlehem were alive with the soft rustling of sheep and the low murmur of shepherds keeping watch. Suddenly, the sky above the fields was filled with radiant light, and an angel of the Lord appeared. The shepherds shielded their eyes, trembling in fear as the glory of the Lord surrounded them.

The angel spoke gently, calming their fears: *"Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people. For today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord."*

The shepherds listened in awe as the angel continued: *"This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."*

The significance of the sign was not lost on these shepherds. They knew the Tower of the Flock, the place where lambs destined for sacrifice were born and wrapped in swaddling cloths. The angel’s message was clear: this child was no ordinary baby. He was the Savior, the Lamb of God, who would take away the sins of the world.

Suddenly, a multitude of heavenly beings appeared, praising God and saying, *"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among people with whom He is pleased."*

As the light faded and the angels disappeared, the shepherds stood in stunned silence. Then, with hearts bursting with wonder and joy, they hurried to the Tower of the Flock. There, in the humble manger, they found the newborn Messiah, just as the angel had said. Mary and Joseph welcomed them warmly, marveling at the story the shepherds shared.

The shepherds knelt in worship before the child, knowing they were in the presence of the long-awaited Savior. Leaving the tower, they went out into the night, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, and they told everyone they met about the miraculous events of that holy night.

The tower, standing tall and steadfast, marveled at the fulfillment of God’s promise. The Lamb of God had come, not just to be cared for by shepherds, but to save the whole world. The shepherds returned to their fields, glorifying and praising God for all they had seen and heard.

### Chapter 7: The Shadow, the Image, and the Light (For Children)
#### The Tower of the Flock explained

A long time ago, God showed His love for His people through shadows—special stories and events that gave a picture of something wonderful He was planning. Think of it like when you see a shadow of someone coming around the corner. You can tell someone is there, even though you can’t see them yet. The shadow gives you a clue of what’s coming. The stories in the Bible, like the lambs at the Tower of the Flock, were shadows that gave clues about Jesus, God’s perfect Lamb, who was coming to save the world. The Migdal Eder, or Tower of the Flock, was one of those places where these shadows could be seen. It was a special place where lambs were born, carefully wrapped in soft cloths, and kept safe until they could be brought to Jerusalem for a very important sacrifice.

But these lambs were not the final gift. They were just a picture of something much greater—God’s perfect Lamb, Jesus.

Jesus’ birth happened at a very special time of year—the Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles. During this festival, families built small huts out of branches and leaves and lived in them for a whole week to remember how God cared for the Israelites in the wilderness. It was like a big camping trip with a special message: God is always with us. When Jesus was born during this time, it was as if God was saying, “Now I have come to live with you in person!” His birth was perfect in every way—even the timing—showing that God’s love is always with us.

As Jesus grew up, He showed the world what God’s love looks like. When He rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, it was like the lambs that were brought through the Lamb’s Gate for Passover. And when Jesus gave His life on the cross, He became the ultimate sacrifice, just like the lambs from the Migdal Eder. He took away the sins of the world so that everyone who believes in Him could be close to God.

God planned every little detail, from the way Jesus was born to the time of His birth. Everything showed how perfect and loving His plan is. The shadows—like the lambs at the Migdal Eder—helped people recognize Jesus when He arrived. And when Jesus was born, those shadows became real.

Jesus is the Light of the World. He is the Lamb of God. He is the reason we can know God and be close to Him.

### Chapter 8: The Tower’s Story

The Tower of the Flock had been there for so many years, watching and waiting. It had seen shepherds caring for their flocks, it had seen lambs wrapped in cloths and placed in the manger, and it had seen the joy and sorrow of God’s people. But on the night Jesus was born, the tower saw the most important moment of all.

The tower had always been part of God’s plan, though it stood silently. It was there when Jacob’s sorrow turned into hope. It watched over Ruth as her story became one of redemption and love. In Ruth’s time, a kinsman redeemer was like a family helper or rescuer—someone who stepped in to protect and take care of a family member in need. Ruth had no husband or children to take care of her, but Boaz, a kind man from her family, chose to help her. He married Ruth, gave her a home, and provided for her and her family. Through Boaz, God showed His love by giving Ruth a new beginning and a place in His story. It stood tall when David, the shepherd boy, was chosen to be king. And finally, it saw the Savior of the world wrapped in swaddling cloths and resting in the manger.

The tower knew that everything had led to this one special moment—the moment when God Himself came to live with His people. Jesus, God’s perfect Lamb, was born to keep every promise God had made. The shadows, like the lambs in the tower, had always been clues about Him. Now, those clues had come true, and the tower saw God’s love up close. He showed that God’s love is perfect, and His timing is always right.

Even though the Tower of the Flock was made of stones, it carried a message that would last forever: God is with us. The tower had been a witness to shadows, but now it saw the Light. Jesus was born to bring hope, to save us, and to make a way for us to be with God forever.

The tower’s story is really God’s story—a story of love, redemption, and joy. It reminds us that God uses even the smallest things—like a manger, a shepherd boy, or a quiet tower—to show His glory. And just like the tower, we can stand tall, knowing that God’s promises are true, and He is always with us.
