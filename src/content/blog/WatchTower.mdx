### Chapter 1: The Tower of the Flock (*Genesis 35:21*)

> "Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder." (*Genesis 35:21, NASB2020*)

Long ago, in the rolling hills of Canaan, a special tower stood tall above the fields. It was called *Migdal Eder* — the Tower of the Flock. Built of sturdy stones, this watchtower was a shelter for shepherds and their flocks. At its base were pens where sheep could safely rest, and inside, shepherds carefully tended to the lambs, especially those born in the cool of night.

The Tower of the Flock had stood for generations by the time Jacob, now called Israel, journeyed through this land with his family. The fields near the tower were quiet as Jacob led his flocks and herds past its shadow. He had just experienced great sorrow. His beloved wife, Rachel, had passed away while giving birth to their youngest son, Benjamin, just a short distance away in Bethlehem. Grieving but determined, Jacob pressed onward, guiding his family toward the future God had promised them.

Jacob stopped near the tower to rest. As he gazed at the structure, he thought of his life—how God had watched over him, much like a shepherd watches over his flock. The tower stood as a reminder that God’s care is constant, even in the midst of pain and loss. Jacob’s heart, heavy with grief, was also full of hope. He trusted that God’s promises would be fulfilled through his children, just as God had said.

For now, though, the tower stood quietly, watching over the fields and the flocks, a silent witness to God’s unfolding plan. As Jacob and his family moved on, the shepherds returned to their work.

### Chapter 2: The Shepherd Priests and the Newborn Lamb (*Micah 4:8*)

> "As for you, tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you it will come—yes, the former dominion will come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem." (*Micah 4:8, NASB2020*)

Four hundred years later, in the same quiet fields near *Migdal Eder*, a group of shepherds diligently cared for their flocks. These were no ordinary shepherds; they were Levites, priests tasked with raising lambs destined for sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem. The lambs born under their watch needed to be perfect, without blemish, for they would be offered as Passover sacrifices, reminding the people of God’s deliverance from Egypt.

On this particular night, the crisp air carried the gentle sounds of bleating sheep. Inside one of the stone pens at the base of the tower, a ewe was giving birth. The shepherd priests worked skillfully, guiding the newborn lamb into the world. As the tiny creature took its first breaths, they carefully wrapped it in swaddling cloths to protect it from harm. These cloths, clean and soft, ensured that the lamb would remain spotless, ready for its sacred purpose.

The shepherds placed the swaddled lamb in a manger, a hollowed-out trough filled with fresh straw. It would rest there, safe and warm, until it could stand on its own. The priests paused, observing the lamb. This one, they knew, would one day be carried to Jerusalem and presented at the Temple as a Passover sacrifice. It was a solemn and holy moment, one they had experienced many times but never took lightly. Each lamb born under their care held a purpose far greater than its humble beginnings.

Outside, the stars shone brightly over the fields and the tower, a quiet witness to the sacred work of the shepherd priests. The Tower of the Flock stood steadfast, its shadow stretching across the land, as if it, too, awaited the day when the ultimate Lamb of God would fulfill the promise of salvation for all.

### Chapter 3: A Season of Hardship (*Micah 5:2*)

> "But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you One will come forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His times of coming forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity." (*Micah 5:2, NASB2020*)

The following summer brought great hardship to the land. A relentless drought scorched the fields around *Migdal Eder*, leaving the grass brittle and sparse. The shepherd priests struggled to care for their flocks as water sources dried up, and the ewes grew weak from the lack of nourishment. When lambing season came, the challenges worsened. Many lambs were born with blemishes or spots, unfit for the sacred Temple sacrifices. It seemed that, for the first time in years, they would have no lambs to offer.

The shepherds were heartbroken as they worked tirelessly to save their flocks, but the burden weighed heavily on them. Without perfect lambs, they could not fulfill their duty to provide for the Temple sacrifices, a task they regarded as a sacred trust. The swaddling cloths, once used to wrap spotless lambs, remained clean and unused, hanging neatly on hooks inside the tower. The shepherds could only pray for rain and restoration, trusting that God’s provision would come in time.

The tower stood steadfast as always, overlooking the weary shepherds and their struggling flocks. Though the season was harsh, the Tower of the Flock remained a silent witness, its shadow stretching over the fields as a reminder of God’s faithfulness, even in the most difficult times.

### Chapter 4: The Journey to Bethlehem (*Luke 2:1–4*)

> "Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth. This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all the people were on their way to register for the census, each to his own city. Now Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David." (*Luke 2:1–4, NASB2020*)

That same year, the roads leading to Bethlehem were busy with travelers. The Roman Emperor had ordered a census, and families from far and wide returned to their ancestral towns to be registered. Among these travelers was a young couple from Nazareth. The man, Joseph, led the way, guiding their donkey over the dusty paths. His wife, Mary, sat quietly on the animal’s back, her face glowing with the gentle anticipation of motherhood. She was carrying a child—a child whose arrival had been foretold by angels.

As the couple entered Bethlehem, they were met with the bustling noise of the crowded town. Travelers filled every available space in the inns, leaving no room for latecomers like Joseph and Mary. Rejected by the innkeeper and with no other options in the busy city, Joseph led Mary back outside the town, searching for a place where she could give birth safely and with some measure of warmth.

Just beyond the city, the Tower of the Flock rose against the horizon. Its silhouette stood out in the fading light, and it seemed to shine as though illuminated by a divine beacon. Drawn to the tower, the couple made their way toward it, feeling as though God Himself was guiding their steps. Mary’s time was near, and they needed shelter. The tower, where shepherds once swaddled newborn lambs, would soon serve a greater purpose than anyone could have imagined.

### Chapter 5: The Angels and the Sign of the Manger (*Luke 2:8–12*)

> "In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock at night. And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood near them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. And so the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people; for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.'" (*Luke 2:8–12, NASB2020*)

As Mary gave birth to her son in the quiet shelter of the Tower of the Flock, the fields outside Bethlehem were alive with the soft rustling of sheep and the low murmur of shepherds keeping watch. Suddenly, the sky above the fields was filled with radiant light, and an angel of the Lord appeared. The shepherds shielded their eyes, trembling in fear as the glory of the Lord surrounded them.

The angel spoke gently, calming their fears: "Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people. For today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord."

The shepherds listened in awe as the angel continued: "This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."

The significance of the sign was not lost on these shepherds. They knew the Tower of the Flock, the place where lambs destined for sacrifice were born and wrapped in swaddling cloths. The angel’s message was clear: this child was no ordinary baby. He was the Savior, the Lamb of God, who would take away the sins of the world.

Suddenly, a multitude of heavenly beings appeared, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among people with whom He is pleased."

As the light faded and the angels returned to heaven, the shepherds stood in stunned silence. Then, with hearts bursting with wonder and joy, they hurried to the Tower of the Flock. There, in the humble manger, they found the newborn Messiah, just as the angel had said. Mary and Joseph welcomed them warmly, marveling at the story the shepherds shared.

The shepherds knelt in worship before the child, knowing they were in the presence of the long-awaited Savior. Leaving the tower, they went out into the night, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, and they told everyone they met about the miraculous events of that holy night.

And so, the Tower of the Flock, once a place for lambs destined for sacrifice, became the birthplace of the Lamb of God, the Savior who would bring salvation to the world.
