## I. The Introduction (vs. 1:1-51)  

### **John Chapter 1**  
**_In Chapter 1, John_** introduces Jesus as the eternal Word, who was with God and is God, through whom all things were made. John the Baptist testifies about Jesus (*vs. 29*), and Jesus calls His first disciples. **_Christ is presented as_** *“The Word of God”* (*vs. 1*), *“the Lamb of God”* (*vs. 29*), *“The Son of God”* (*vs. 34*), and *“the King of Israel”* (*vs. 49*). **_But as many as_** *“received Him”* (*vs. 12*), follow Him as His disciples, and declare, *“We have found the Messiah”* (*vs. 41*).

## II. The Ministry of Presentation to the Nation  

### **John Chapter 2**  
**_In Chapter 2, Jesus_** performs His first miracle at the wedding in Cana, turning water into wine, and cleanses the temple in Jerusalem. At Cana, He reveals His glory, leading His disciples to believe in Him (*vs. 11*). **_Christ is presented as_** the one who has authority over creation and life, revealing Himself as *The Temple of God* (*vs. 19*). **_Believers should_** trust in His power to transform lives (*vs. 11*), and honor God’s holiness in worship.

### **John Chapter 3**  
**_In Chapter 3, Jesus_** teaches Nicodemus about the necessity of being born again to see the kingdom of God and declares God’s love for the world (*vs. 16*). John the Baptist also exalts Jesus (*vs. 30*). **_Christ is presented as_** the Son of God who gives eternal life to those who believe in Him (*vs. 15-16*), and the one who came not to judge the world but to save it (*vs. 17*). **_Believers are_** born again by the Spirit (*vs. 5-6*), live in the light of truth (*vs. 21*), and exalt Christ in their lives, letting Him increase while they decrease (*vs. 30*).

### **John Chapter 4**  
**_In Chapter 4, Jesus_** speaks with the Samaritan woman at the well, revealing Himself as the Messiah and teaching about true worship (*vs. 24*). He teaches His disciples about the urgency of spiritual harvest (*vs. 35*), and many Samaritans believe in Him after hearing the woman’s testimony and meeting Him. **_Christ is presented as_** the living water that satisfies the soul (*vs. 14*), the Messiah (*vs. 26*), and the Savior of the world (*vs. 42*). **_Believers should_** worship God in spirit and truth (*vs. 24*), share their testimony boldly (*vs. 39*), and work in His harvest, rejoicing when others come to know Him (*vs. 36*).


### **John Chapter 5**  
**_In Chapter 5, Jesus_** heals a man at the pool of Bethesda on the Sabbath, prompting controversy with the religious leaders. He declares His unity with the Father (*vs. 19*), and speaks of His authority to give life and execute judgment. **_Christ is presented as_** the Son of God who has been given authority over life, judgment, and resurrection (*vs. 21-29*). **_Believers should_** honor the Son as they honor the Father (*vs. 23*), listen to His words to receive eternal life (*vs. 24*), and trust in His power to raise the dead and bring judgment (*vs. 28-29*).
