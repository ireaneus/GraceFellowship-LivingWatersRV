# Galatians Chapter 1

**Introduction**  

vs.1 *"Paul, an apostle (not sent from men nor through human agency, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),"* vs.2 *"and all the brothers who are with me,"*  
*"To the churches of Galatia:"*    
vs.3 *"Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,"* vs.4 *"who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,"* vs.5 *"to whom be the glory forevermore. Amen."*  

**Distortion of the Gospel**  

vs.6 *"I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel,"* vs.7 *"which is not just another account; but there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ."* vs.8 *"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!"* vs.9 *"As we have said before, even now I say again: if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!"*  
vs.10 *"For am I now seeking the favor of people, or of God? Or am I striving to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ."*  

**Paul Defends His Ministry**  

vs.11 *"For I would have you know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel which was preached by me is not of human invention."* vs.12 *"For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ."*  
vs.13 *"For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it;"* vs.14 *"and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions."* vs.15 *"But when He who had set me apart even from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace was pleased"* vs.16 *"to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,"* vs.17 *"nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus."*  
vs.18 *"Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him for fifteen days."* vs.19 *"But I did not see another one of the apostles except James, the Lord’s brother."* vs.20 *"(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)"* vs.21 *"Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia."* vs.22 *"I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which are in Christ;"* vs.23 *"but they only kept hearing, “The man who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy.”* vs.24 *"And they were glorifying God because of me."*

### Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ

Both Peter and Paul greet the churches with the same greeting "Grace to you, and peace" 

> Grace = God's unmerited favor and blessing, In the context of the New Testament, it often denotes God's gracious gift of salvation and His continued favor and blessing on believers.

> Peace = In the New Testament, "eirēnē" often describes the peace that comes from God, reconciling believers to Himself through Christ and fostering harmonious relationships among His people.

**1. χάρις (charis)**:
   - **Meaning**: Grace, favor, kindness
   - **Context**: In the Greek language, "charis" conveys the idea of grace as goodwill and loving-kindness given by God or expressed in human relationships. It can refer to favor that one receives without any merit, emphasizing the unearned and generous nature of God's grace. In the context of the New Testament, it often denotes God's gracious gift of salvation and His continued favor and blessing on believers.

**2. εἰρήνη (eirēnē)**:
   - **Meaning**: Peace, harmony, tranquility
   - **Context**: "Eirēnē" in Greek signifies a state of peace, including the absence of conflict and a sense of inner tranquility. It extends to both personal peace (inner well-being and rest) and relational peace (harmony between individuals or groups). In the New Testament, "eirēnē" often describes the peace that comes from God, reconciling believers to Himself through Christ and fostering harmonious relationships among His people.

# Key Supporting Scripture
- 2 Peter 3:15-16  
*"and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you, as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which there are some things that are hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction."*

- 2 Tim. 3:16-17  
*"All Scripture is inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man or woman of God may be fully capable, equipped for every good work."*

- Romans 10:17 *"Faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the Word of God"
- 2Cor. 7:10 
*"For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death."*  

- Eph. 2:8-9 
*"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."*  

- Acts 7:55-56,58; 8:1 *"But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.” When they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him; and the witnesses laid aside their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul. Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death. And on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles."*

- Eph. 1:4-5 *"just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love, He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,"* 


# Prevenient Grace 
**Prevenient Grace** is a theological term used to describe the grace of God that precedes human decision and enables the sinner to respond to His offer of salvation. This grace is often associated with God's initiating work in salvation, softening the heart and drawing individuals to Him. While the term itself is not directly found in Scripture, its concept is reflected in several biblical passages.

### Key Aspects of Prevenient Grace:
1. **God’s Initiative in Salvation**  
   Prevenient grace highlights that salvation begins with God, not human effort.  
   - *John 6:44*: "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day."
   - *Philippians 2:13*: "For it is God who is at work in you, both to desire and to work for His good pleasure."

2. **Enabling Response to the Gospel**  
   This grace is understood as God's work in enabling the spiritually dead sinner to respond to the gospel.  
   - *Ephesians 2:4-5*: "But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our wrongdoings, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)."
   - *Romans 2:4*: "Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and restraint and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?"

3. **The Universal Aspect of Grace**  
   Prevenient grace is often seen as universally available, giving every person the opportunity to respond to God.  
   - *Titus 2:11*: "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people."
   - *John 12:32*: "And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to Myself."

4. **Conviction of Sin**  
   The Holy Spirit’s role in convicting the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment is an expression of prevenient grace.  
   - *John 16:8*: "And He, when He comes, will convict the world regarding sin, and righteousness, and judgment."

### Summary:
Prevenient grace demonstrates God’s proactive love and mercy, breaking through human inability and spiritual deadness to make salvation possible. It aligns with passages like *Romans 5:8*—"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us"—underscoring that God always takes the first step toward humanity. This grace is not irresistible but works to enable the free choice to accept or reject the gospel. 

Prevenient grace, therefore, is the foundation of God's redemptive work, ensuring that salvation remains an act of divine initiative and grace from start to finish (*Ephesians 2:8-9*).
