## I. The Preface 1:1-4  
## II. The Preparation of the Savior vs. 1:5-2:52  

### **Luke Chapter 1**  
**_In Chapter 1, Luke_** recounts the angel Gabriel’s announcements to Zechariah and Mary about the births of John the Baptist and Jesus, respectively. Mary visits Elizabeth, and John is born, with Zechariah prophesying about God’s salvation plan (*vs. 67-80*). **_Christ is presented as_** *"Son of the Most High"* whose arrival fulfills God’s covenant to David and Abraham (*vs. 32-33, 54-55*). **_I believe with Zechariah,_** on the whole of his prophecy but my key verse is *“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people”* (*vs. 68*).  

### **Luke Chapter 2**  
**_In Chapter 2, Luke_** recounts the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, the shepherds’ visitation, His presentation at the temple, and the account of His interaction with the teachers in Jerusalem as a boy. **_Christ is presented as_** *“a Savior, who is Christ the Lord”* (*vs. 11*), proclaimed to the shepherds at His birth. **_I believe my key verse is,_** *“A Light of revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel”* (*vs. 32*), spoken by Simeon. *"Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.”* (*vs. 14*), proclaimed by the heavenly host at His birth.

## The introduction of the Savior vs. 3:1-4:15

### **Luke Chapter 3**  
**_In Chapter 3, Luke_** describes the ministry of John the Baptist, who preaches repentance for the forgiveness of sins and baptizes Jesus. John declares the coming of one mightier than himself, and Jesus’ baptism is marked by the descent of the Holy Spirit and the voice of the Father. **_Christ is presented as_** *“My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased”* (*vs. 22*), as declared by the Father at His baptism. **_I believe my key verse is,_** *“John answered and said to them all, ‘As for me, I baptize you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire’”* (*vs. 16*).

---

## IV. The Ministry of the Savior 4:16-9:50  

### **Luke Chapter 4**  
**_In Chapter 4, Luke_** records Jesus’ temptation in the wilderness, His inaugural teaching in the synagogue of Nazareth, and the beginning of His healing and deliverance ministry in Capernaum. Jesus declares the fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy, and rebukes Satan’s temptations by quoting Scripture. **_Christ is presented as_** *"The fulfillment of Scripture" (*vs. 21*)  **_I believe my key verse is,_** *““I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose.”* (*vs. 43*) because the main theme of the Bible is about Christ and His Kingdom.

### **Luke Chapter 5**  
**_In Chapter 5, Jesus_** calls His first disciples, heals a leper, forgives and heals a paralytic, and calls Levi (Matthew) to follow Him. He demonstrates His power over sickness, sin, and the hearts of men. **_Christ is presented as_** *“the Son of Man who has authority on earth to forgive sins”* (*vs. 24*). **_Believers should_** listen and obey Him, saying, *“Master, I will do as You say”* (*vs. 5*), humbly acknowledge their sinfulness, *“Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man!”* (*vs. 8*), and respond to His call, *“Follow Me”* (*vs. 27*).

### **Luke Chapter 6**  
**_In Chapter 6, Jesus_** declares Himself Lord of the Sabbath, teaches the Beatitudes, and calls His followers to love their enemies, judge not, and bear good fruit. He also heals a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath, confronting the Pharisees. **_Christ is presented as_** *“the Son of Man [who] is Lord of the Sabbath”* (*vs. 5*). **_I rejoice and trust in,_** *“Blessed are you when people hate you, and ostracize you, and insult you… Rejoice on that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven”* (*vs. 22-23*), looking forward to when He says to me, *“Well done, good and faithful servant”* (*Matthew 25:21*).

### **Luke Chapter 7**  
**_In Chapter 7, Jesus_** heals the centurion’s servant, raises a widow’s son from the dead, and commends John the Baptist’s ministry. He forgives the sins of a woman who anoints His feet with perfume, declaring her faith has saved her. **_Christ is presented as_** *“a great prophet”* (*vs. 16*) and *"The Expected One"* (*vs. 19, Isaiah 35:5-6, Isaiah 61:1*). **_Believers should_** consider themselves unworthy, as the centurion did when he said, *“I am not worthy for You to come under my roof”* (*vs. 6*). *“But a man must examine himself,”* (*1 Corinthians 11:28*).

### **Luke Chapter 8**  
**_In Chapter 8, Jesus_** teaching in parables, calming a storm, casting out demons from a man in the Gerasenes, healing a woman with a hemorrhage, and raising Jairus’ daughter from the dead. Despite Jesus saying, *“Let us go over to the other side”* (*vs. 22*), the disciples’ fear during the storm reveals their struggle to fully trust in His word. **_Christ is presented as_** *“the one whom even the wind and the waves obey”* (*vs. 25*), demonstrating His sovereign authority over creation and life. **_I want to be that guy,_** who, after being healed, obeyed Jesus’ command to *“Return to your house and describe what great things God has done for you”* (*vs. 39*), sharing his testimony with the entire city.

### **Luke Chapter 9**  
**_In Chapter 9, Luke_** describes Jesus sending out the twelve, feeding the five thousand, revealing His glory during the transfiguration, and teaching about the cost of discipleship. Jesus predicts His suffering, death, and resurrection. **_Christ is presented as_** *“The Christ of God”* (*vs. 20*), the anointed King foretold in *Psalm 2:2-7*, and the ruler born in Bethlehem, *“whose times of coming forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity”* (*Micah 5:2*). **_Believers should_** trust in Him to provide for all their needs (*vs. 16*), observing how this miracle was distributed: each disciple returned to Jesus to refill their baskets, a reminder that provision comes continually from Him.

## V. The Mission of the Savior vs. 9:51-18:30  

### **Luke Chapter 10**  
**_In Chapter 10, Jesus_** sends out seventy disciples to proclaim the kingdom of God, teaching about loving one’s neighbor through the parable of the Good Samaritan, and commending Mary for choosing to sit and listen at His feet, reminding His followers that true joy should come from their names being written in heaven (*vs. 20*). **_Christ is presented as_** *“the Lord of the harvest”* (*vs. 2*), who sends workers to bring in the spiritual harvest. **_Believers should_** obey His call to *“Go!”* (*vs. 3*), because *“The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few”* (*vs. 2*), serve others with sacrificial love (*vs. 33-37*), and prioritize time being in His presence (*vs. 41-42*).

### **Luke Chapter 11**  
**_In Chapter 11, Jesus_** teaches His disciples to pray, using what is known as the Lord’s Prayer, and emphasizes persistence in prayer. He rebukes the Pharisees and lawyers for their hypocrisy and warns against seeking signs instead of responding to His teaching. **_Christ is presented as_** *“one greater than Jonah and Solomon”* (*vs. 31-32*), calling people to repentance and wisdom. **_Believers should_** persist in prayer, as Jesus said, *“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you”* (*vs. 9*), and live authentically, avoiding hypocrisy (*vs. 39-52*).

### **Luke Chapter 12**  
**_In Chapter 12, Jesus_** warns His disciples against hypocrisy, greed, and anxiety, urging them to seek God’s kingdom first. He tells the parable of the rich fool, teaches about trusting God’s provision, and calls for readiness for His return. **_Christ is presented as_** the one who comes to bring division (*vs. 51*) and the one who *“casts fire upon the earth”* (a reference to the Holy Spirit, *Acts 1:8*). **_Believers should_** *“not be afraid, little flock, because your Father has chosen to give you the kingdom”* (*vs. 32*) and *“be ready; because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think”* (*vs. 40*).

### **Luke Chapter 13**  
**_In Chapter 13, Jesus_** teaches about repentance using the examples of the Galileans and the fallen tower of Siloam, tells the parable of the barren fig tree, and heals a crippled woman on the Sabbath. He warns of the narrow door to salvation (*vs. 24*) and laments over Jerusalem’s rejection of Him. **_Christ is presented as_** the rejected Messiah of Israel: *“Behold, your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you will not see Me until you say, ‘Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord!’”* (*vs. 35*). **_Believers should_** repent without delay (*vs. 3*), bear fruit in their lives (*vs. 6-9*), and *“strive to enter the narrow door”* by following Jesus faithfully (*vs. 24*).

### **Luke Chapter 14**  
**_In Chapter 14, Jesus_** heals a man with dropsy on the Sabbath, teaches about humility through the parable of the wedding feast, and challenges His followers to count the cost of discipleship. He emphasizes the need for full commitment (*vs. 27*) and tells the parable of the great banquet, where the invited guests, symbolizing Israel, reject the invitation. **_Christ is presented as_** the Messiah to the Gentiles, calling them from *“the roads and the hedges”* to fill His house (*vs. 23-24*). **_Believers should_** heed His words: *“If anyone comes to Me and hates even his own life, he cannot be My disciple. Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple”* (*vs. 26-27*).

### **Luke Chapter 15**  
**_In Chapter 15, Jesus_** tells three parables: the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son, illustrating God’s joy over the repentance of sinners. He emphasizes the love and mercy of the Father, who welcomes back the repentant with open arms. **_Christ is presented as_** the Good Shepherd who seeks the lost and rejoices over their return (*vs. 4-7*). **_Believers should_** reflect the Father’s heart by forgiving others and celebrating their repentance, just as the father said, *“This brother of yours was dead and has begun to live, and was lost and has been found”* (*vs. 32*).

### **Luke Chapter 16**  
**_In Chapter 16, Jesus_** teaches about stewardship through the parable of the dishonest manager and warns against the love of money. He tells the story of the rich man and Lazarus, showing the eternal consequences of ignoring God’s commands and neglecting others. **_Christ is presented as_** the one who reveals the sufficiency of God’s Word, saying, *“If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead”* (*vs. 31*). **_Believers should_** live with eternal priorities, being faithful stewards of what God has entrusted, and heed the Word of God as their guide for repentance and salvation (*vs. 10-13, 31*).

### **Luke Chapter 17**  
**_In Chapter 17, Jesus_** teaches His disciples about forgiveness, faith, and gratitude, warning against causing others to stumble. He cleanses ten lepers, but only one returns to give thanks, and He speaks of the coming of the kingdom of God, saying, *“The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed”* (*vs. 20*). **_Christ is presented as_** the King who reveals the presence of God’s kingdom among His people (*vs. 21*). **_Believers should_** forgive others repeatedly (*vs. 4*), live with a thankful heart (*vs. 15-18*), and remain vigilant, for *“the Son of Man will be revealed”* in His time (*vs. 30*).

### **Luke Chapter 18**  
**_In Chapter 18, Jesus_** teaches on persistent prayer through the parable of the persistent widow, contrasts humility and pride in the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector, and welcomes children, saying, *“Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all”* (*vs. 17*). He also challenges a rich young ruler about the cost of following Him and foretells His death and resurrection. **_Christ is presented as_** the Son of Man who will be mocked, mistreated, killed, and rise on the third day (*vs. 31-33*). **_Believers should_** pray persistently and not lose heart (*vs. 1*), humble themselves before God (*vs. 14*), and follow Jesus with childlike faith and trust (*vs. 17*).

## VI. The Passion of the Savior vs. 18:31 - 23:56

### **Luke Chapter 19**  
**_In Chapter 19, Jesus_** visits Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector who repents and is restored, teaches the parable of the minas to illustrate stewardship and accountability, and enters Jerusalem triumphantly, being praised as the King who comes in the name of the Lord. He weeps over Jerusalem, lamenting their failure to recognize the time of their visitation. **_Christ is presented as_** the King who brings salvation, saying, *“The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost”* (*vs. 10*). **_Believers should_** receive Jesus joyfully, like Zacchaeus (*vs. 6*), steward their lives for God’s glory (*vs. 13*), and proclaim Him as King, rejoicing that *“Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!”* (*vs. 38*).

### **Luke Chapter 20**  
**_In Chapter 20, Jesus_** confronts the religious leaders with parables and teachings, exposes their hypocrisy, and challenges their understanding of the Messiah by asking, *“How is it that they say the Christ is David’s son?”* (*vs. 41*). Quoting Psalm 110:1, He reveals that the Christ is not only David’s descendant but also his Lord, emphasizing His divine nature. **_Christ is presented as_** the eternal Lord who fulfills both the Davidic covenant and divine sovereignty (*vs. 42-44*). **_Believers should_** recognize Jesus as both Lord and Messiah, avoiding the hypocrisy of the scribes, and love God with all their heart, soul, and mind (*vs. 46-47*).

### **Luke Chapter 21**  
**_In Chapter 21, Jesus_** teaches about the end times, warning of signs such as wars, earthquakes, and persecution, while encouraging His followers to stand firm in their faith. He speaks of the destruction of the temple, saying, *“Not one stone will be left upon another”* (*vs. 6*), and assures them of His return in glory, commanding, *“Straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near”* (*vs. 28*). **_Christ is presented as_** the sovereign King who will return in power and great glory to establish His kingdom (*vs. 27*). **_Believers should_** remain watchful and pray, as Jesus said, *“Keep watch at all times, praying that you will have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man”* (*vs. 36*).

### **Luke Chapter 22**  
**_In Chapter 22, Jesus_** celebrates the Last Supper with His disciples, institutes the Lord’s Supper, and predicts Peter’s denial. He prays in agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, saying, *“Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done”* (*vs. 42*), before being betrayed by Judas and arrested. **_Christ is presented as_** the suffering Servant who submits to the will of the Father, even in the face of betrayal and death (*vs. 42*). **_Believers should_** remember His sacrifice, as He commanded, *“Do this in remembrance of Me”* (*vs. 19*), and pray for strength to resist temptation, as Jesus urged, *“Pray that you do not come into temptation”* (*vs. 40*).

### **Luke Chapter 23**  
**_In Chapter 23, Jesus_** is tried before Pilate and Herod, sentenced to crucifixion, and dies on the cross, bearing the sins of the world. On the cross, He prays, *“Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing”* (*vs. 34*), and promises the repentant thief, *“Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise”* (*vs. 43*). **_Christ is presented as_** the King of the Jews who willingly lays down His life for sinners (*vs. 3, 38*). **_Believers should_** reflect on His forgiveness and mercy, trusting in His promise of eternal life, as demonstrated in His words to the repentant thief (*vs. 43*).

---

## VII. The Resurrection of the Savior vs. 24:1 - 51

### **Luke Chapter 24**  
**_In Chapter 24, Jesus_** rises from the dead, appears to two disciples on the road to Emmaus, and later reveals Himself to the eleven, explaining how the Scriptures foretold His suffering and resurrection. He commissions His disciples to proclaim repentance and forgiveness of sins in His name to all nations and ascends into heaven. **_Christ is presented as_** the risen Savior who fulfills the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms (*vs. 44*), and brings salvation to the world. **_Believers should_** rejoice in His resurrection and obey His command to be witnesses, as He said, *“You are witnesses of these things”* (*vs. 48*).
