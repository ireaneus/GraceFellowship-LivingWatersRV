### **Ice Breaker**

**The Story**  
Johnny woke up one Sunday morning and decided he didn’t want to go to church that day. He felt tired and uninspired, and he’d rather go fishing.

He said to his wife, “I don’t want to go today. The sermon is always too long and boring, the people don’t like me, and I’m not sure I like them either.”

His wife, who was already getting ready, looked at him and said, “Well, Johnny, you have to go.”

“Why?” he asked.

She replied, “Because you’re the pastor!”

1. **Ice Breaker Reflection**  
   - Have you ever had a “Johnny moment” when you didn’t feel like going to church or engaging spiritually? What happened when you did?  
   - Why do you think God often meets us most powerfully when we’re least expecting it?

### **Greetings**
"Grace and peace to you from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you all for taking the time out of your weekly schedules to come and dive into the Word of God. I pray that through this study, we all will draw closer to our Master and King Jesus Christ. If any of you don’t know Jesus, I welcome you too and pray this study will reveal to you the real Christ, King, and Living God and with a repentant heart, surrender and come to know Him as your personal Lord and Savior."

**Introduction to the Study**
"Today, we are beginning our study into the end times. Before we dive into that topic, we need to lay some foundational groundwork on interpreting Scripture. The end times study is filled with Old Testament references, so it’s essential that we have a solid understanding of the Old Testament to interpret the last book of the Bible correctly."

### **In the Beginning God**

#### **Scripture Reading**
**Genesis 1:1-5**  
> *In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was a formless and desolate emptiness, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” And there was evening and there was morning, one day.*

**John 1:1-5**  
> *In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of mankind. And the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not grasp it.*

2. **Genesis 1 and John 1**  
  - What does “In the beginning, God” teach us about His sovereignty and role as Creator?
  - How does He introduce Himself?
  - What are the first words He speaks?
  - What is the significance of the statement: "God saw that the light was good"?
  - How does God reveal His plan of redemption even early on in these 5 verses?
  - How did God reveal He is the originator of the scientific laws?

### Focus Statement
*"The emphasis of this study is to show God demonstrating His perfect characteristics. Even before creating mankind, God introduced space for evil to reside (darkness). This was intentional so that He could fully reveal all of His characteristics, including His justice, mercy, grace, and sovereignty, to mankind."*

### **The Message of the Bible**

**Christ-Centric Focus**  
> **John 5:39** - *You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me.*

3. **Christ-Centric Scripture**  
   - How does knowing the Bible testifies about Christ shape the way we study it?  
   - Can you think of examples where the Old Testament foreshadows Jesus?

**Statement**  
"The NEW is in the OLD contained—the OLD is in the NEW explained. The NEW is in the OLD concealed—the OLD is in the NEW revealed. The entirety of Scripture declares that the person and work of Jesus Christ is the central theme. He is the promised King, the Redeemer of God’s people, and the One through whom God’s glory is displayed. As Paul proclaims: *'For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever.'* **(Romans 11:36)**."

### **Proofs of a Grand Designer**

1. **The Godhead**: The Son is described as the Word and the Light.
2. **The Light**: Represents and is Christ.
3. **Darkness**: Created by God, not merely the absence of light.
4. **God’s Plan**: Already in motion, creating both light and darkness.

**Isaiah 45:6-7**  
> *That men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun  
> That there is no one besides Me.  
> I am the LORD, and there is no other,  
> The One forming light and creating darkness,  
> Causing well-being and creating calamity;  
> I am the LORD who does all these.*

### **Questions for Reflection and Discussion**

4. **God’s Sovereignty**  
   - How does Isaiah 45:6-7 expand your view of God’s control over creation, light, and darkness?  
   - What does it mean to trust a God who forms both light and darkness?

5. **Personal Reflection**  
   - How can understanding Christ as the Light and the Word transform your daily life?  
   - In what ways do you see God’s fingerprints as the Grand Designer in your life?

### **Closing and Next Steps**

**1 Thessalonians 4:13-18**  
> *But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as indeed the rest of mankind do, who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose from the dead, so also God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus. For we say this to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who remain, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. Therefore, comfort one another with these words.*
